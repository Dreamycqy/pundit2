            <BR><SPAN style=""> <BR>      Suppose a man described a game of chess, without mentioning  the existence and operations of the pawns.  His description  of the game as a natural phenomenon will be incomplete.  On  the other hand we may say that he has completely described a  simpler game.  In this sense we can say that Augustine's description of learning the language was correct for a simpler  language than ours.  Imagine this language:-<BR> 1).   Its function is the communication between a builder A &amp;  his man B.  B has to reach A building stones.  There are cubes,  bricks, slabs, beams, columns.  The language consists of the  words “cube”, “brick”, “slab”, “column”.  A calls out one of  these words, upon which B brings a stone of a certain shape.   Let us imagine a society in which this is the only system of  language.  The child learns this language from the grown-ups  by being trained to its use.  I am using the word “trained”  in a way strictly analogous to that in which we talk of an animal being trained to do certain things.  It is done be means of  example, reward, punishment, and such like.  Part of this training is that we point to a building stone, direct the attention  of the child towards it, &amp; pronounce a word.  I will call  this procedure <SPAN style="border-bottom-width: thin; border-bottom-color: #000000; border-bottom-style: solid;">demonstrative</SPAN> teaching of words.  In the actual         <TABLE width="100%" style="border-bottom-style: solid; border-width: 1px; color: #FF0000;"><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE>

<BR>  <DIV style="text-align: right; margin-right: 250px; margin-bottom: 15px;">2.</DIV> use of this language, one man calls out the words as orders,  the other acts according to them.   But learning and teaching  this language will contain this procedure: The child just  “names” things, that is, he pronounces the words of the language when the teacher points to the things.  In fact, there  will be a still simpler exercise: The child repeats words which  the teacher pronounces. </SPAN><BR>
