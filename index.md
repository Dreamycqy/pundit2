#What is Pundit

Pundit is a web application that allows users to annotate web pages.
Compared to others annotations tool Pundit is a bit "special" since it allows to create **semantic annotations**.
This is the **developers site** where we provide technical information. For more general information about the project and
the blog please visit the [Pundit website](http://thepund.it/).

#How to use Puntid

There are three main ways you can use Pundit:

##Chrome Extension

This is the preferred way of using Pundit as a general purpose application to annotate **general web pages** while browsing the web.
The extension allows you to launch Pundit on any page you want to annotate and build your semantic annotations.

The Chrome Extension will be available soon, follow [Pundit on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_thepundit) to get some fresh updates and know
when the Extension will be released.

##Embed Pundit in your project

In the case of custom archives or web sites where is possible to hardcode some HTML code inside the pages we can directly inject the Pundit code.
So Pundit will be launched as the page loads.
In this case we can use a custom configuration there properties ontologies and entities can be used.
This case is detailed in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12k4QIxI5SlF-IQEsVSnUBjM-OnVVLDHSWKjfT8vNEco/edit#heading=h.i2z2e4ye4ui1

##Feed the Pundit

For custom archives where we don't want to embed the Pundit code we can use also Feed.
Feed also allows to work with Images and RDF files. See the following section for more details on how feed works.
